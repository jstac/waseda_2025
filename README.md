## Syllabus

Recent years have seen rapid improvement in computational environments for
artificial intelligence and deep learning. This intensive course on
computational economics will provide a fast-paced introduction to useful tools
for economic modeling from these fields. We will draw on numerical techniques
currently deployed in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
reinforcement learning.  We will cover a range of economic applications, with a
focus on stochastic dynamic models.
